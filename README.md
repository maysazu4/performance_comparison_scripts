# Performance Comparison Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts for comparing the performance of various algorithms or methods. Each script measures the execution time of different approaches for solving a particular problem and provides visualizations of the results.

## Scripts

1. **fibonacci_performance.py**: Compares the performance of standard recursive Fibonacci calculation and an optimized version using memoization.

2. **search_algorithm_performance.py**: Compares the performance of linear search and binary search algorithms for searching a target number in a list of varying sizes.

3. **word_occurrence_count_performance.py**: Compares the performance of two methods for counting the occurrences of words in text files: using dictionaries and sorting.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- External modules (specified in each script)
- 'draw_results.py' module for drawing comparison graphs and saving results to CSV files.
